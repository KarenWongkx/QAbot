I am planning to relocate to a new place of residence. Am I allowed to engage more than 2 movers from a moving company to help me to shift my furniture and belongings?,"Yes. If you are relocating from one place of residence to another, more than 2 workers from a moving company are allowed to enter your home, to support the relocation of furniture and belongings from the old to the new residential address."
What is the prevailing permissible group size for social activities?,The prevailing permissible group size and number of visitors to households per day is currently two persons.
"My household consists of more than two people. Can we all go out together, since we are from the same household?","We understand that some families need to move in bigger groups of more than 2 persons, especially those with young children or elderly parents, and we are prepared to provide flexibility for these families. Family members staying together, meaning sharing the same residential address, can go out in groups larger than 2 persons.
This may include taking public transport, going for medical appointments, attending classes, grocery shopping or going to work in the same vehicle. However, please do try to minimise the number of such large group outings and also try to keep to 2 persons as much as possible to minimise your family’s potential exposure to the virus.
Please help us to uphold a public discipline that keeps Singapore safe."
Is my family allowed to travel in the same taxi or private hire car?,Families from the same household may travel in the same taxi or private hire car even if there are more than 2 persons. This means that family members that do not live together should split into separate groups of not more than 2 if they wish to take taxis or private hire cars.
My parents usually come over to help me with caring for my children on weekdays. Can they do so?,"Grandparents may go over to help with child-caring arrangements, however, they will contribute to the prevailing permissible visitor cap to a household per day.
Families who are relying on grandparents for childcare on a daily basis are advised to take the necessary safe distancing precautions to protect the grandparents. Observe personal hygiene and try to reduce interaction time as far as possible when visiting . Do not visit if you are unwell. 
Grandparents are also strongly encouraged to take the COVID-19 vaccination, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households as much as possible."
My siblings and I drop our children off at their grandparents’ house on weekdays. Will this be allowed?,"Grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not be counted towards the cap of two distinct visitors per household, or to the number of social gatherings per day.
Grandparents are also strongly encouraged to take the COVID-19 vaccination, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households as much as possible."
I am divorced and my children take turns to live with me and my ex-spouse. Can this arrangement continue?,"Yes, this is allowed."
"Can I organise an outdoor taichi / yoga session with my friends in the park for more than two persons, as long as we keep in groups of two?","The safe distancing measures are put in place to minimise interactions to prevent transmission. In line with the spirit of the intent, social gatherings of more than the prevailing permissible group size should not take place.
